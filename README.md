# NanairoParadise

All of my source code for my website :3

## What is this?

Exactly as it says on the tin.
The source code for my website, [Nanairo Paradise](nanairoparadise.neocities.org).
Yes, I'm using Neocities as the host, bite me.

## Note About The Branches

All development and testing is being done using the `nightly` branch.
This is so that pages and stuffs can be tested locally.
The `main` branch is what'll ultimately be uploaded onto Neocities.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Make the changelog page. (Slated for v0.2.x)
- [ ] Make the about page. (Slated for v0.3.x)
- [ ] Make the art gallery. (Slated for v0.4.x)
- [ ] Hopefully make a section for Ten'en Project. (Slated for v1.0)
- [ ] Maybe transfer the entirety of the Zoukagamiroku project over to here? (Possibly slated for v2.0)
