## What is this?

Exactly as it says on the tin.
The source code for my website, [Nanairo Paradise](nanairoparadise.neocities.org).
Yes, I'm using Neocities as the host, bite me.

## Note About The Branches

All development and testing is being done using the `nightly` branch.
This is so that pages and stuffs can be tested locally.
