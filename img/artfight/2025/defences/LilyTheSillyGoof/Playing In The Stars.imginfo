    This is a drawing where she is manipulating the stars!  I drew her in a new outfit that was more flowy!  Hope you enjoy her floating in the stars and comets of the deep dark space!

  <Notes>
    I would've drawn our OCS interacting, but I've already had this drawing sketched for 2 weeks unfortunately and didn't realize you have permission for that until afterwards ðŸ’”.  It would've worked since my character/sona is moon themed.  Sorry, but I hope you enjoy!!
