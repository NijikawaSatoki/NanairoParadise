# TEN'EN KUROAKUSHI ~ Tales of the Maelaet

## Opening

Rise and shine, miss Shinogawa.
Rise and shine.

Not that one would suggest that you're being derelict with your duties.
None is more deserving of sleep's strong grasp.
And all your effort in this world of yours would have gone to waste had... well, you'll see soon enough.

One who has found themself in the wrong place at the wrong time can make all the difference in the world, or so it often appears to mere mortal senses.

So wake up, young Shinogawa.
Wake up, and smell the ashes of war, Okimi.

## Author Note

And this is what happens when I've played Half-Life 2 so much lol.

But indeed, we'll see soon enough.
So let's wake up, and smell the ashes.
