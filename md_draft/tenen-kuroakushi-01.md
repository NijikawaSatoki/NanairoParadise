### ∆ On a train in Akhalipshi ∆

Okimi was sitting in the seat, looking at her phone.
A few moments later, the train finally arrived at its destination.
Okimi looked up from ver phone and saw the rain outside.

“If only I knew where everyone was, and if they're alright...”
Okimi lamented, sighing quite audibly.

“You'll find them.”

“Huh?”
Okimi let out as she turned to see a young person, no older than she is.
“Who're you?”

“Just a person passing through.”
The person replied.

“Okay...”
Okimi was even more confused.
“You could at least tell me your name..”
The person let out a light chuckle.

<ZhuzuriText title="Madgalina">
«Mædygaljina.»
</ZhuzuriText>
The person replied.
Since the language was unfamiliar, Okimi could only tilt ver head in confusion.

“What was that?”
Okimi asked, hoping for clarification.
The person repeated themself.
“I literally do not understand what you just said.”

“Sorry...”
The person, moving to sit down across from Okimi.
“I'm Madgalina.
 My sisters call me Madgi though.”

<Note style="font-family:sans-serif;">
(*) Madgalina's pronouns are it/its.
</Note>

“I see.”
Okimi said, shifting her weight some.

“I guess you don't speak Zhuzuri, do you?”
Madgalina asked.

“I do not.”
Okimi replied.
The train then jerked as it started moving again.

<Zhuzuri title="Next stop: Ækhsærtæglipsu.">
«Lvælj Gõnjy: Ækh'sært'ægjljip's'ü.»
</Zhuzuri>
The announcement came over the intercom.

“That's where I'm going.
 Ækhsærtæglipsu.
 It isn't far from Ochamleti, being in the same republic district and all.”
Madgalina said.

“What for?”
Okimi asked, curious.

“I...
 I can't say...”
Madgalina replied, bringing its knees up to its chest.
“My sisters said that no one but me is supposed to know the reason for me going there...”

“Sorry..
 Didn't mean to pry like that, Madgi.”
Okimi said apologetically, reaching over to pet Madgalina.
“Those markings on you..”

“They're the pride of my people's species, the zhuze.”
Madgalina replied.

“Not gonna lie, looks like someone took a whole can of paint and splattered it randomly all over you.”

“What did you expect of a painted dog?”
Madgalina giggled.
The rain outside intensified.

### ∆ On the bridge of the Ushie royal flagship, *Reitatsu* ∆

Nagato, the captain of the *Reitatsu*, sat in the command chair, pondering.

“Captain Watatsumi.”
A voice called out behind Nagato.
She turned around to its crewmate and best friend, Kusari.

“Find out anything about Her Bitchiness' whereabouts?”
Nagato asked.

<Note style="font-family:sans-serif;">
(*) Nagato calls Okimi “Her Bitchiness” due to Okimi's occasional snarky (and bitchy) attitude.
</Note>

“Unfortunately, no.”
Kusari lamented.

“I see...”

“However, according to Hoshidera's sibling, it's possible that Lady Shinogawa might've ended up near Ochea's port town, Püüngelim.
 Maybe we could dock there and begin a search?”
Kusari explained, nervously clawing at their own scales.

“Better than nothing.”
Nagato said, leaning forward.
“No use remaining docked here in Claeq-Swary.”
Nagato then stood up and approached the bridge crew.

“Captain?”
A bridge officer inquired.

“Listen up.
 We are leaving Claeq-Swary at this instant.
 Plot your course for Püüngelim, in Ochea.”
Nagato explained to its crew.

“Aye aye, captain!”
The bridge crew replied in unison.
