### ∆ On a train in Akhalipshi ∆

Okimi was sitting in the seat, looking at her phone.
A few moments later, the train finally arrived at its destination.
Okimi looked up from ver phone and saw the rain outside.

“If only I knew where everyone was, and if they're alright...”
Okimi lamented, sighing quite audibly.

“You'll find them.”

“Huh?”
Okimi let out as she turned to see a young person, no older than she is.
“Who're you?”

“Just a person passing through.”
The person replied.

“Okay...”
Okimi was even more confused.
“You could at least tell me your name..”
The person let out a light chuckle.

<ZhuzuriText title="Madgalina">
«Mædygaljina.»
</ZhuzuriText>
The person replied.
Since the language was unfamiliar, Okimi could only tilt ver head in confusion.

“What was that?”
Okimi asked, hoping for clarification.
The person repeated themself.
“I literally do not understand what you just said.”

“Sorry...”
The person, moving to sit down across from Okimi.
“I'm Madgalina.
 My sisters call me Madgi though.”

<Note style="font-family:sans-serif;">
(*) Madgalina's pronouns are it/its.
</Note>

“I see.”
Okimi said, shifting her weight some.

“I guess you don't speak Zhuzuri, do you?”
Madgalina asked.

“I do not.”
Okimi replied.
The train then jerked as it started moving again.

<Zhuzuri title="Next stop: Ækhsærtæglipsu.">
«Lvælj Gõnjy: Ækh'sært'ægjljip's'ü.»
</Zhuzuri>
The announcement came over the intercom.

“That's where I'm going.
 Ækhsærtæglipsu.
 It isn't far from Ochamleti, being in the same republic district and all.”
Madgalina said.

“What for?”
Okimi asked, curious.

“I...
 I can't say...”
Madgalina replied, bringing its knees up to its chest.
“My sisters said that no one but me is supposed to know the reason for me going there...”

“Sorry..
 Didn't mean to pry like that, Madgi.”
Okimi said apologetically, reaching over to pet Madgalina.
“Those markings on you..”

“They're the pride of my people's species, the zhuze.”
Madgalina replied.

“Not gonna lie, looks like someone took a whole can of paint and splattered it randomly all over you.”

“What did you expect of a painted dog?”
Madgalina giggled.
The rain outside intensified.

### ∆ On the bridge of the Ushie royal flagship, *Reitatsu* ∆

Nagato, the captain of the *Reitatsu*, sat in the command chair, pondering.

“Captain Watatsumi.”
A voice called out behind Nagato.
She turned around to its crewmate and best friend, Kusari.

“Find out anything about Her Bitchiness' whereabouts?”
Nagato asked.

<Note style="font-family:sans-serif;">
(*) Nagato calls Okimi “Her Bitchiness” due to Okimi's occasional snarky (and bitchy) attitude.
</Note>

“Unfortunately, no.”
Kusari lamented.

“I see...”

“However, according to Hoshidera's sibling, it's possible that Lady Shinogawa might've ended up near Ochea's port town, Püüngelim.
 Maybe we could dock there and begin a search?”
Kusari explained, nervously clawing at their own scales.

“Better than nothing.”
Nagato said, leaning forward.
“No use remaining docked here in Claeq-Swary.”
Nagato then stood up and approached the bridge crew.

“Captain?”
A bridge officer inquired.

“Listen up.
 We are leaving Claeq-Swary at this instant.
 Plot your course for Püüngelim, in Ochea.”
Nagato explained to its crew.

“Aye aye, captain!”
The bridge crew replied in unison.

### ∆ Back with Okimi and Madgalina ∆

Okimi and Madgalina were still sitting on the train.
Soon, the train stopped.

“Here we are.
 Ækhsærtæglipsu.”
Madgalina said as they both stood up.

“Hey, this sounds embarrassing, but could you show me around town?”
Okimi asked as she reached for her cane.
Madgalina's eyes lit up with excitement.

“I'd love to!”
Madgalina shouted with excitement, wagging her tail wildly.
The two of them got off the train and Madgalina showed Okimi around town, from the town's historic cathedral to town hall.
But trouble was brewing.
As the duo were walking around town, some Akhacyli soldiers approached them.

<Note style="font-family:sans-serif;">
(*) Akhacyli (pronounced [axat͡sɘli]) is the name of Akhalipshi's military, who unfortunately double as police.
</Note>

“Hm?”
Madgalina let out.
“Is something wrong?”

“Unfortunately, yes.
 President Chikhtisova has called you back to Zærond.”
The soldier said before noticing Okimi.
“You don't look familiar.”
The soldiers then reached for their sidearms.

“Wait, she's not a threat!
 Okimi's a friend I made on the train ride here!”
Madgalina said, getting between the soldiers and Okimi.

“Stupid *yjv*.
 You brought an outsider to this town, knowing its importance to the program!”
The other soldier scolded Madgalina.

<Note style="font-family:sans-serif;">
(*) In the Zhuzuri language, yjv (pronounced [ɪɥ]) is an ableist slur used primarily against autistic folk.
Madgalina is unfortunately too used to being called that, and doesn't bother pushing back, even though it should.
Also yes, Ækhsærtæglipsu is not unlike a Soviet-era closed city.
</Note>

“How did you get onto the train that comes here?
 Because that train line is only for this town's residents.”
The first soldier interrogated Okimi.

“I was just boarding trains to get around.
 Ain't my fault all the signs are in Zhuzuri, *a language that I can't read or speak*.”
Okimi explained.

“Arrest her.”
The soldier ordered their partner.

“Don't touch me!”
Okimi shouted loudly, bringing her left hand on Kanmuaiken, ready to draw it from its scabbard.
“I'm warning you!”

“Drop your weapon and surrender!
 You are wanted for espionage!”
Both soldiers shouted, raising their rifles.

“Okimi, I'd listen if I were you...”
Madgalina tried to persuade Okimi, but a third soldier grabbed her right arm from behind.

“I SAID DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME!!”
Okimi screamed as she drew Kanmuaiken from its scabbard and slashed at the soldier that grabbed her.
This prompted the two previous soldiers to rush her and tackle her to the ground.

“We'll add attempted murder and resisting arrest to the charges.”
A fourth soldier walked up to them.
They then shifted their attention to Madgalina.
“Madgi.”

“That voice...”
Madgalina quivered as she fell to the ground.
“Sissy...”
The soldier then removed their helmet.

“Lady Irina...”
The soldiers said in unison.

“Madgi.
 You know I could arrest you on suspicion of treason, right?”
Irina said, gently grabbing her sibling's shoulders.

“I.... I'm....”

“Come on.
 I'll punish your *yjv* ass when we get home.”
Irina said as a military police wagon rolled up to the scene.
“Throw the *yjv* girl into the back.
 I don't care if she hits her head.”
